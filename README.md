## Testing Markdown with _Links_

I want to put in a link to [Gatherer][Card-base], but I don't know how.
This one is for [EDHREC][Commander-base], but its evil twin [EDHREC][Card-base] goes to [Gatherer][Card-base].

## Testing Markdown with _Lists_
I have two deck ideas right now.

   2. Play Ninjas
   3. Rain Fire (Instants and Sorceries)
- Aryel, Knight of Windgrace
   1. Make Knights
   2. Make Knights
   3. Make Knights
   4. Punch Face
